home page:
home page after loggin in should be a new one. nav bar includes, home favorites (user email-not clickable). Top right should have logout /

home page has list of songs. Song image, name, artist. Button to add to favorites //

clicking add to favorites, adds song to favorite and switches page to favorites page

favs page: 
see all favorited songs, next to it has remove Button

songs also have button that says details


details page:
once you are in details of a song, you see info about it(will choose later), and in bottom will have comment section

top of comment section has input and send button

under that has a box of comments(username top, comment under)

next to username has a remove button to remove comment

things to remember: 

GET renders ejs. Render takes ejs
res.redirect sends you to new route(url) 
ejs files don't take comments



Questions:

Creating models. user, user favorites(removing favorites from models), song model for comments 

Is it easier to make comments linked with user and only user can delete or is it better once comment is made its there.
Better to have user input name or can I automatically add it?

For details, we need song name, how do i make params song name since its weird notation?
